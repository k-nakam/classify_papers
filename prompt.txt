You are an expert political methodology coder.
Your task is to extract structured information from the top-tier political science articles.
You MUST output a SINGLE valid JSON object with the keys listed below.
If information is not available or unclear, use:
- null for free-text/number fields

23. "sample_size": integer or null 
    - Main sample size (number of respondents) for the primary analysis.
    - Extract from regression table or description of N =.
24. "response_rate": number or null
    - Response rate as numeric percentage if provided, e.g. 35.6 for 35.6%.
    - If several are given, choose the main or overall response rate.
25. "target_population": string or null - For NON-EXPERIMENTAL surveys: description, e.g. "adult US population", "women in Georgia", etc.
    - If only experimental, still describe target if given.
26. "weighting_used": integer
    - Were survey weights used? 
    - 0 = No 
    - 1 = Yes 
    - 3 = Indeterminate / unclear
27–33. IF WEIGHTS USED: what factors are included in weighting?
    For each factor, use:
        - 0 = No evidence that this factor is in weights
        - 1 = Factor clearly included in weights
        - 3 = Indeterminate / unclear
    Fields: 
        "weight_factor_gender": integer 
        "weight_factor_race": integer 
        "weight_factor_age": integer 
        "weight_factor_party": integer 
        "weight_factor_education": integer 
        "weight_factor_region": integer

34. "sample_nature": string or null
    - Nature of sample: one of or similar to: "US national", "non-US national", "multiple countries", "subpopulation(s)", "other", e.g. "US college students".
35. "survey_organization": string or null 
    - E.g. "YouGov", "Lucid", "PureSpectrum", "Ipsos", "GfK", etc. - Or null if not specified.
36. "institutional_survey": integer 
    - Is it a standard institutional survey (ANES, GSS, Census, WVS, Pew, Kaiser, etc.)? 
    - 0 = No 
    - 1 = Yes 
    - 3 = Indeterminate
37. "validation_measures": integer 
    - Are any measures used to validate survey respondents? 
    - Include things like: attention checks, speed checks, CAPTCHAs, bot checks, consistency checks. 
    - Codes: 
        - 0 = No clear validation measures mentioned
        - 1 = Yes, at least one validation measure
        - 3 = Unknown / not mentioned
        - 4 = "rapid questioning" or similar as explicit special validation strategy
38. "completion_rate": number or null 
    - Completion rate = number of respondents who complete survey / number who begin it.
    - As numeric percent, e.g. 80.5 for 80.5%.
39. "screening_completion_rate": number or null
    - Screening completion rate = number who pass quality threshold / number who complete survey.
    - Use 3 if value is mentioned only as "indeterminate".
    - Otherwise numeric percent, e.g. 70.0. To represent this clearly: 
        - If numeric rate given: set this field to numeric percent (e.g., 70.0). 
        - If explicitly indeterminate / can't compute: set to null AND add note in "notes" field.
40. "prob_sampling_method_employed": integer 
    - IF sample is probability-based (or paper states probability sampling): 
        - 0 = No (no clear probability sampling method described) 
        - 1 = Yes (e.g., random digit dialing, address-based sample, random sampling from a frame) 
        - 3 = Indeterminate / unclear
41. "nonprob_quotas_employed": integer 
    - IF sample is nonprobability-based (or online panel etc.): 
    - 0 = No quotas mentioned

    - 3 = Indeterminate / unclear
42. "notes": string or null
    - Short free-text explanation, especially if anything is ambiguous or multiple surveys are used.

IMPORTANT:
- ALWAYS output a SINGLE JSON object with exactly these keys.
- DO NOT include any extra commentary outside the JSON.
- If the article does not obviously use a survey, still fill what you can and explain in "notes".
